## üìù Project Overview

WikiMaps is a week-long midterm project as part of the Lighthouse Labs Web Dev bootcamp, created in combination with Ian Cameron, Paul Chen, and Will Zak. WikiMap is a single page application where users with accounts can create, edit, and delete maps with no, one, or multiple points that include titles, descriptions, and photos. 

The application is used to highlight knowledge of: 
    - NodeJS 
    - Express with RESTful routes 
    - Bulma CSS framework
    - jQuery
    - SASS CSS preprocessor
    - PostgreSQL and pg for DBMC
    - git for version control
    - Responsive Design

## ‚úÖ Getting Started

1. Create the `.env` by using `.env.example` as a reference: `cp .env.example .env`
2. Update the .env file with your correct local information 
  - username: `labber` 
  - password: `labber` 
  - database: `midterm`
3. Install dependencies: `npm i`
4. Fix to binaries for sass: `npm rebuild node-sass`
5. Reset database: `npm run db:reset`
  - Check the db folder to see what gets created and seeded in the SDB
7. Run the server: `npm run local`
  - Note: nodemon is used, so you should not have to restart your server
8. Visit `http://localhost:8080/`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings & Tips

- Do not edit the `layout.css` file directly, it is auto-generated by `layout.scss`
- Split routes into their own resource-based file names, as demonstrated with `users.js` and `maps.js`
- Split database schema (table definitions) and seeds (inserts) into separate files, one per table. See `db` folder for pre-populated examples. 
- Use the `npm run db:reset` command each time there is a change to the database schema or seeds. 
  - It runs through each of the files, in order, and executes them against the database. 
  - Note: you will lose all newly created (test) data each time this is run, since the schema files will tend to `DROP` the tables and recreate them.
